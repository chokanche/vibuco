# S3 in Vibuco

We use S3 to store our images. Later we will also implement upload functionality with this.

## Buckets

Make sure you have set the right bucket names as environment variables:

```
PUBLIC_BUCKET_NAME='vibuco-public-photos'
COMMON_BUCKET_NAME='vibuco-common-photos'
```

### vibuco-public-photos

Contains the public photos and are publicly accessible. Anyone with the link can access these photos. These are also accessed by the not logged in page of our application.

### vibuco-common-photos

Contains the common photos that will be loaded in when the user is logged in. So the reason this is called 'common' for now is that these images are common across the logged in users. Later we will add the functionality that a user can also view images that is uploaded by the account.

## Signed url

We generate signed urls for when the user is logged in and loads in the images. This is a safe practice. This functionality is done with the function defined in `helpers/presignImageSources.js`.
